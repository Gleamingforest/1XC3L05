(a)How are the iterative and recursive algorithms similar and different for the same test cases?Which has more repetition?
Both functions execute instructions repeadly until a condition is met and an output is produced. recursive algorithm calls itself over and over again, thus the function repeats multiple time until a condition is met. In an iterative algorithm the number of iterations is defined and therefore can have less repetitions.
(b) What is the most executed line in the iterative and recursive algorithms? Are they the same?
for both algorithm the most executed line is line 242: for (int i = 0; i < 1000; j++){
(c) Are there any parts of the code which are not exercised?
Yes Commas semi-colons and blank lines
(d) If we were to try to optimize either function, where would be a good place to start?
ON line 242
